# HeFQUIN
HeFQUIN is a query federation engine for heterogeneous federations of graph data sources (e.g, federated knowledge graphs) that is currently under development by [the Semantic Web research group at Link√∂ping University](https://www.ida.liu.se/research/semanticweb/).

# Quick Start

HeFQUIN can be run as a web service or using a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool. 

## Running HeFQUIN as a web service
The web service can be run using docker, an embedded server, or an existing servlet container (e.g., Tomcat or Jetty).

### Run using Docker
Download or clone the project from the HeFQUIN repository and navigate to the project root in a terminal. Build and run the latest version of the engine using:
```bash
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up
```

The optional build argument (`TAG`) can used to build the image from a specific release:
```yml
  hefquin:
    build:
      context: .
      args:
        TAG: <insert tag>
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
```

The engine can be configured by mounting custom configuration files when starting up the container:
```yml
  hefquin:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
     - ./example/config.properties:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/config.properties
     - ./example/ExampleEngineConf.ttl:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/ExampleEngineConf.ttl
     - ./example/ExampleFedConf.ttl:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/ExampleFedConf.ttl
```

where the `config.properties` file has the following structure:
```bash
ENGINE_CONF_FILE=ExampleEngineConf.ttl   # the engine configuration file
FED_CONF_FILE=ExampleFedConf.ttl         # the federation configuration file
```

By default the service exposes a SPARQL endpoint at `http://localhost:8080/sparql`.  

### Run using embedded server

__Option 1:__ Clone the project from the HeFQUIN repository and navigate to the project root in a terminal. Build the latest version of the engine using:
```bash
$ mvn clean package
```
To use a specific release, checkout the tag before building:
```bash
$ git checkout <insert tag>
$ mvn clean package
```

__Option 2:__ Download a jar file from the set of available releases (see [Releases](https://github.com/LiUSemWeb/HeFQUIN/releases)).

Run the server from a terminal using:
```bash
java -cp target/HeFQUIN-x.y.z-SNAPSHOT.jar se.liu.ida.hefquin.service.HeFQUINServer
```

The engine can be configured by modifying the `config.properties` file in the working directory. The `config.properties` file has the following structure:
```bash
ENGINE_CONF_FILE=ExampleEngineConf.ttl   # the engine configuration file
FED_CONF_FILE=ExampleFedConf.ttl         # the federation configuration file
```

### Run using an existing servlet container

__Option 1:__ Clone the project from the HeFQUIN repository and navigate to the project root in a terminal. Build the latest version of the engine using:
```bash
$ mvn clean package
```
To use a specific release, checkout the tag before building:
```bash
$ git checkout <insert tag>
$ mvn clean package
```

__Option 2:__ Download a jar file from the set of available releases (see [Releases](https://github.com/LiUSemWeb/HeFQUIN/releases)).

Deploy `target/HeFQUIN-x.y.z-SNAPSHOT.war` in your serlet container.

The engine can be configured by modifying the `config.properties` file in the working directory. The `config.properties` file has the following structure:
```bash
ENGINE_CONF_FILE=ExampleEngineConf.ttl   # the engine configuration file
FED_CONF_FILE=ExampleFedConf.ttl         # the federation configuration file
```
> __NOTE__: The servlet will need to be restarted for any changes in the engine configuration to take effect.


## Run HeFQUIN using the CLI Tool

__Option 1:__ Clone the project from the HeFQUIN repository and navigate to the project root in a terminal. Build the latest version of the engine using:
```bash
$ mvn clean package
```
To use a specific release, checkout the tag before building:
```bash
$ git checkout <insert tag>
$ mvn clean package
```

__Option 2:__ Download a jar file from the set of available releases (see [Releases](https://github.com/LiUSemWeb/HeFQUIN/releases)).

Example usage:
```bash
java -cp target/HeFQUIN-0.0.4-SNAPSHOT.jar se.liu.ida.hefquin.cli.RunQueryWithoutSrcSel \
    --query ExampleQuery.rq \
    --federationDescription ExampleFederation.ttl \
    --confDescr ExampleEngineConf.ttl
```

For a full list of the available CLI options use:
```bash
java -cp target/HeFQUIN-x.y.z-SNAPSHOT.jar se.liu.ida.hefquin.cli.RunQueryWithoutSrcSel --help
```

### Features of HeFQUIN
* Support for all features of SPARQL 1.1 (where basic graph patterns, group graph patterns (AND), union graph patterns, optional patterns, and filters are supported natively within the HeFQUIN engine, and the other features of SPARQL are supported through integration of the HeFQUIN engine into Apache Jena)
* So far, support for SPARQL endpoints, TPF, and brTPF
  * [work on openCypher Property Graphs ongoing](https://github.com/LiUSemWeb/HeFQUIN/tree/main/src/main/java/se/liu/ida/hefquin/engine/wrappers/lpgwrapper)
  * [work on GraphQL APIs ongoing](https://github.com/LiUSemWeb/HeFQUIN/tree/main/src/main/java/se/liu/ida/hefquin/engine/wrappers/graphqlwrapper)
* Initial support for vocabulary mappings
* [Heuristics-based logical query optimizer](https://github.com/LiUSemWeb/HeFQUIN/wiki/Heuristics-Based-Logical-Query-Optimizer)
* Several different [cost-based physical optimizers](https://github.com/LiUSemWeb/HeFQUIN/wiki/Cost-Based-Physical-Query-Optimizers) (greedy, dynamic programming, simulated annealing, randomized iterative improvement)
* Relevant [physical operators](https://github.com/LiUSemWeb/HeFQUIN/wiki/Physical-Operators); e.g., hash join, symmetric hash join (SHJ), request-based nested-loops join (NLJ), several variations of bind joins (brTPF-based, UNION-based, FILTER-based, VALUES-based)
* Two execution models (push-based and pull-based)
* Features for getting an understanding of the internals of the engine
  * printing of logical and physical plans
  * programmatic access to execution statistics on the level of individual operators and data structures, as well as printing of these statistics from the CLI
* 380+ unit tests

### Current Limitations
* HeFQUIN does not yet have a source selection component. All subpatterns of the queries given to HeFQUIN need to be wrapped in SERVICE clauses.
